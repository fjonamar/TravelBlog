      <h2 id="wlh1">FROM CONTENT CREATORS TO WORLD TRAVELERS</h2>

      <h3 id="bgn">How did it all begin? </h3>
      <p id="bgn1">One day, during our lunch break, we stumbled upon a travel magazine that showcased breathtaking destinations 
        and inspiring travel stories. As we flipped through the pages, an idea sparked between us:<span>"Why not become the
         protagonists of our own travel stories?</span>"<br><br>
        Determined to turn our dreams into reality, we started planning weekend getaways to nearby destinations. 
        <br><br>
        <img id="thai" src="chiang.jpg"><br>
         A trip to Thailand opened our eyes even more. <br><br>
         There, in the wonderful city of Chiang Mai, we met five backpackers who showed us that we didn't have to be tied down to our job 
         or be rich to travel. That we could travel long term and on a budget. And that millions of people did it each year. <br><br> We wanted in. 
         We wanted to do what they were doing. <br><br>
         After careful consideration and a leap of faith, we decided to leave our content creation jobs and devote our time and energy 
         entirely to our travel aspirations.<br><br><br>
         We've been to over 100 countries and territories, traveled hundreds of thousands of miles around the globe, slept in over a thousand hostels, tried some unique food, made lifelong friends, learned multiple languages, and, most importantly, made it our mission now to help travelers like <span>YOURSELF</span> to realize <span>YOUR</span> travel dreams the same way those five backpackers helped us realize ours.</p>
        <h2 id="wlh3">WHAT YOU'LL LEARN HERE</h2>
      <p id="bgn1">If you've ever wanted to learn how to travel cheaper, experience a destination's authentic side, and turn your dream trip into a reality, you are in the right place. This website will give you road-tested tips, advice, and suggestions so you can see and do more for less.</p>
      <h3 id="bgn3">On this website, you will find:</h3>
      <ul type="square">
        <li>Tested travel tips from years of experience</li>
        <li>A community of supportive travelers to help encourage you to keep going</li>
        <li>Detailed cost breakdowns to help you better budget for your trip</li>
      </ul>
      <p id="bgn1">Every day we wake up with one goal in mind:<span> “How can we help other people travel better for less?”</span> The mission here is to be more comprehensive than any other website out there.
        <br><br>
        Unlike many other travel websites, you won't find sponsored content or paid trips here. Every hostel, restaurant, or attraction has been personally visited by me, my team, or one of my guest columnists.
        <br><br4></br4>
        And we pay our own way.
        <br><br>
        We sleep in dorms and budget hotels, wait hours for buses, try those roadside street stalls, and test travel passes to see if they really do save you money, get lost in cities, and try to find all the off-beat attractions and cool deals we can. We do it just like you would — because, like you, we're real travelers who just want to explore the world more.
        <br><br>
        All our recommendations are here because they are useful and used in our day-to-day travels. We recommend what we use.
        <br><br>
        <span>This website is about showing you what it's really like on the road </span> — not some glossy ad for a travel brand.
        <br><br>
        So come, read, learn, go sooner, and send a postcard from the road!</p>
